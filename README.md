## Election Audit Summary
The python script we used to analyse the results of Colorado local congressional election can be used to analyse any election audit results by modifying the script. With the help of the original script, we were able to find the number and percentage votes for seperate counties, total number of votes cast in the election for all three counties and winner of the election. We created a python script which were able to read and write data, performed calculations on the counts, and used loops and conditional statements to report our analysis.
  
  * Modifying the source of data in csv file in the below code will help the election commission to find the total number of votes cast in the election and the votes recived by each candidate

  * By using loops and conditionals, we would be able to find out the total vote count and largest county turnout. We will also be able to find the winning percentage in each county
